Game created using javascript.  

Click a button to generate a password that is 8-128 characters in length with lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

## Description

 This project's goal was to create a password of varying length and composed of random character combinations based on user's input.  The application should ask the user what length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and/or special characters) the user would like to use and validate the users requests, then generate a password based on user's selected criteria and print it in designated box.

 This project helped me further understand javascript coding and how it allows for user interaction with the browser.  I explored playing with window prompts/alerts/confirms, entering functions, math.ramdom, for-loops, pushing and concatenating arrays to new arrays, and local and global variables among other javascript items.
