# robot-gladiators
Game created using javascript.  

## Description

Robot game composed using Javascript on the browser.  Each competitor is set up with a random amount of health and hit points.  There are three rounds total; the user has the opportunity to either fight a robot or skip the fighting round.  Each fight causes a loss of health, but skipping a round costs health points as well.  The last competitor left with points wins the game.
